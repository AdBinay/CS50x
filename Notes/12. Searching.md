# Searching

**Searching** represents how we solve the problem of finding information.

A simple problem has an input of some values, and an output of a `bool`, whether or not a particular value is in the array.

## Big O Notation

When looking at algorithms for searching, to compare _efficiency_, consider **running time**, or how long an algorithm takes to run given some size of input.

In **CS** the **running time** is oftenly described with **big O notation**, which we can think of as _"on the order of"_ something, as though we want to convey an idea of running time and not an exact number of milliseconds or steps.

Reusing the chart from the first lecture where the **red line** is searching linearly (one page ata time), **yellow line** searching two pages at a time, and the **green line**, starting in the middle and dividing the problem in half each time.

If we'd zoom out and change the units on our axes, the **red** and **yellow** lines would end up very close together.

So we use **big O notation** to describe both the **red** and **yellow** lines, since they end up being very similar as _n_ becomes larger and larger. We would describe them as both having _"**big O of n**"_ or _"on the order of n"_ running time.

The **green line** is different in shape even as _n_ becomes very large, so it ttakes _"**big O** of log n"_ steps. The base of the logarithm (2) is also removed since it's a constant factor.

**Common _'Big O'_ running times:**

- **_O_($n^2$)**
- **_O_(n log n)**
- **_O_(n)**
- **_O_(log n)**
- **_O_(1)**

There's also the **big Omega notation** ($\Omega$) which describes the lower bound of number of steps for the algorithm or how few steps it might take, in the best case. **Big O**, is the upper bound of number of steps, or how many steps it might take, in the worst case.

**Common _'Big $\Omega$'_ running times:**

- **$\Omega$($n^2$)**
- **$\Omega$(n log n)**
- **$\Omega$(n)**
- **$\Omega$(log n)**
- **$\Omega$(1)**

There's also a notation which describes the running times of algorithms if the upper bound and lower bound are the same: **the Theta notation** or **$\Theta$**.

- **$\Theta$($n^2$)**
- **$\Theta$(n log n)**
- **$\Theta$(n)**
- **$\Theta$(log n)**
- **$\Theta$(1)**

An algorithm with running time of **_O_(1)** means that a constant number of steps is required, no matter how big the problem is.

## Linear Search

**Linear Search** is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each elements of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues until the end of the set.

- Worst-case performance - **_O_(n)**
- Best-case performance - **_O_(1)**
- Average performance - **_O_($n^2)**
- Worst-case space complexity - **_O_(1)**

- **Representing 'Linear Search' in _pseudocode_:**

```
for each door from left to right
    if number is behind door
        return True

return False
```

**NOTE:** the `return False` is outside the loop, since we only want to do that after we've looked behind all doors.

---

- **Representing 'Linear Search' in _C code_:**

```
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int numbers[] = {4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 5, 0};

    for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
    {
        if (numbers[i] == 0)
        {
            printf("Found\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }

    printf("Not found\n");
    return 1;
}
```

## Binary Search

**Binary Search** find the position of a target value within a sorted list. It compares the target value to the middle element of the array, if they are not equal the half in which the target cannot be is eliminated and the search continues in the remaining half, continuing until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the list.

- Worst-case performance - **_O_(log n)**
- Best-case performance - **_O_(1)**
- Average performance - **_O_(log n)**
- Worst-case space complexity - **_O_(1)**

---

- **Representing 'Binary Search' in _pseudocode_:**

```
if no doors
    return False
if number behind middle door
    return True
else if number < middle door
    search left half
else if number > middle door
    search right half
```

**NOTE:** we remember to check whether there are no doors left, since that means our number isn't behind any of them.

# 1. Linked Lists

**Linked lists** can store a list of values in **different parts of memory**.

- we have the values `1`, `2` and `3`, each stored in some address memory, like `0x123`, `0x456` and `0x789`.
- this is different than an array since our values are no longer next to one another in memory.
- we can use whatever locations in memory that are free.

When **inserting** a new value to a **linked list**, we allocate enough memory for both the value we want to store and the address next to the value.

- next to value `1`, for example, we also store a pointer, `0x456` to the next value and pointer.
- for the last group, we have the null pointer, `0x0`, since there's no next group.

We can also visualize these addresses as just pointers, since we don't need to know what the addresses actually are.

With a **linked list**, we have the tradeoff of needing to allocate more memory for each value and pointer, in order to spend less time adding values.

The next group of boxes with a value and a pointer are called a **node**, a component of a data structure that encapsulates some information. **Nodes** can be implemented with a struct.

## 1.1. Implementing a linked list

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// implement a node using struct
typedef struct node
{
    int number;
    struct node *next;
}
node;

int main(void)
{
    // list of size 0
    node *list = NULL;

    // add number to list
    node *n = malloc(sizeof(node));

    if (n == NULL);
    {
        return 1;
    }

    n->number = 1;
    n->next = NULL;

    // update list to point to a new node
    list = n;

    // add a second number to list
    n = malloc(sizeof(node));

    if(n == NULL)
    {
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }

    n->number = 2;
    n->next = NULL;

    list->next = n

    // add a third number to list
    n = malloc(sizeof(node));

    if (n == NULL)
    {
        free(list->next);
        free(list);
        return 1;
    }

    n->number = 3;
    n->next = NULL;

    list->next->next = n;

    // print list
    for (node *temp = list; temp != NULL; temp->next)
    {
        printf("%i\n", temp->number);
    }

    // free list
    while (list != NULL)
    {
        node *temp = list->next;
        free(list);
        list = temp;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Addresses

When a variable is created in **C**, a **memory address** is assigned to that variable. The address is the location of where the variable is stored on the computer.

To access the address of the variable, the **reference operator (&)** is used.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 30;

    printf("%p\n", &age);
}
```

It will return the **address** in hexadecimal form (0x...) which is just a numbering system with base 16.

## Pointers

**Pointers** store the **memory address** of a variable as its value. To print it, use the `%p` format specifier. **Pointers** give you the ability to manipulate data in the computer's memory which can reduce the code and improve the performance.

They point to a _data type_ of the same type, and is created with the `*` operator.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 30;
    int *pointer = &age;

    # prints out the value of age
    printf("%i\n", age);

    # prints out the memory address of age
    printf("%p\n", &age);

    # prints out the memory address of age with the pointer
    printf("%p\n", pointer);
}
```

In the example above, the pointer variable was used to get the memory address of a variable (used together with the `&` **reference operator**).

There's also the possibility to get the value of the variable the pointer points to with the `*` operator, also known as the **dereference operator**.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int age = 30;
    int *pointer = &age;

    # prints out the memory address of age with the pointer
    printf("%p\n", pointer);

    # prints out the value of age with the pointer
    printf("%p\n", *pointer);
}
```

- When the `*` sign is used in declaration `int* pointer`, it creates a **pointer variable**.
- When not used in declaration, it acts as a **dereference operator**.

## Pointer Arithmetic

**Pointer arithmetic** is the process of applying mathematical operation to pointers, using them just like numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int numbers[] = {4, 6, 8, 2, 7, 5, 0};

    printf("%i\n", *numbers);
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 1));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 2));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 3));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 4));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 5));
    printf("%i\n", *(numbers + 6));
}
```

We add only **1** to the address of `numbers` instead of **4** (**int**s are 4 bytes in size), since the compiler already knows that the type of each value in `numbers` is 4 bytes. With **+1** we're telling the compiler to move the next value in the array, not the next byte.

Also, `numbers` is an array, but we can use it as a pointers with **\*numbers**.

## Compare & Copy

When comparing two integers with the same values, the program works as expected.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int n = 50;
    int m = 50;

    if (n == m)
    {
        printf("Same!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different!\n");
    }
}
```

When comparing two strings with the same inputs, the program will print '_Different!_'.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    char *s = get_string("s: ");
    char *t = get_string("t: ");

    if (s == t)
    {
        printf("Same!\n");
    }
    else
    {
        printf("Different!\n");
    }
}
```

This happens because each **string** is a pointer (char \*) to a different location in memory, where the first character of each string is stored. So even if the characters in the string are the same, this will always print '_Different!_'.

The `get_string()` function has been returning just a **char \***, or a pointer to the first character of a string from the used. Since we called `get string()` twice, we got two different pointers back.

This problem can be solved by using the `strcmp()` function from the `string.h` library, which wll to to each string and compare them character by character.

When trying to copy a string, then capitalize the first letter in the copied one, we see that in both strings the first letter is capitalized.

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void)
{
    string s = get_string("s: ");

    string t = s;

    t[0] = toupper(t[0]);

    printf("s: %s\n", s);
    printf("t: %s\n", t);
}
```

Since we set **s** and **t** to the same value, or the same address, they're both pointing to the same character, and so we capitalized the same character in memory.

# Strings

**String** are _arrays of characters_, which are not defined in **C**, but by the **CS50 Library**.

## Declare a String in C

```
char s = "Hi!";
```

## Declare a String in C using the CS50 Library

```
#include <cs50.h>

string s = "Hi!";
```

Each charater in the **string** is stored in a **byte of memory**. Also **string** end with a _special character_, `\n`, or a byte with all eight bits set to **0**, so the program knows when to string ends. So, for a **string** with **3** characters, we need **4 bytes**.

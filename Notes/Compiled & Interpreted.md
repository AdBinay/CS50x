# Source Code & Machine Code

**Machines** understand only **binary**. When human write **source code**, a list of instructions for the computer that is _human-readable_, machines only understand what is called **machine code**.

**Source code** is converted to **machine code** using **compilers** and **interpreters**.

## Compiled Languages

- Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute.
- They tend to be faster and more efficient.
- They give the developer more control over hardware aspects like memory management and CPU usage.
- They need a _build_ step, meaning they need to be manually compiled first.
- You need to _rebuild_ the program every time there's a change.

### Examples of Compiled Languages:

- C
- C++
- Erlang
- Haskell
- Rust
- Go

## Interpreted Languages

- Are run through a program _line by line_ and execute each command.
- They were once significantly slower than compiled languages, but with development of **just-in-time compilation**, that gap is shrinking.

### Examples of Interpreted Languages:

- Python
- PHP
- Ruby
- JavaScript

Most programming languages can have both **compiled** and **interpreted** implementations. The _language_ itself is not necessarily **compiled** or **interpreted**, but for simplicity, they are referred to as such.

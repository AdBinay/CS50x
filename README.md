# About the Repository

I am currently taking the **[CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)** course, **Harvard University's** introduction to **Computer Science**.

These are the **solutions** I got for the **labs** and **problem sets** I did so far. Also, there's a few **notes** I took in **Markdown** about the **subjects** discussed in the **course**. Most of the **notes** are taken from the **course's** _notes section_, but there's also some **subjects** I did some extra research on.
